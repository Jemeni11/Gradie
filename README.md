## Introduction

Gradie is a design tool that extracts the most prominent colors from an image and turns them into a smooth, beautiful gradient.

## Features

These features can change at any time. Their existence depends on me having enough time or motivation to implement them all tbh.

- 🎨 Extracts dominant colors from an image
- 🌈 Creates a smooth gradient using the extracted palette
- 🔧 Offers multiple gradient strategies:
  - Dominant + first color
  - Dominant + random
  - Dominant + most contrasting
  - Dominant + warmest-to-coolest shift
- 📁 Works with uploaded files or pasted images
- 📋 Copy CSS or image of the gradient
- ⚙️ Export options

## How It Works

1. You upload or paste an image.
2. Gradie extracts the most dominant colors.
3. You choose a gradient mode (like "Dominant + most contrast").
4. Gradie generates a smooth linear gradient using your selection.
5. You export it as CSS or download the image.

## Why did I build this?

I saw a nice-looking image, thought the colours in it would look nice as a gradient background, and here we are!
