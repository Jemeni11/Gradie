## Introduction

Gradie is a design tool that extracts the most prominent colors from an image and turns them into a smooth, beautiful gradient.

## Features

These features can change at any time. Their existence depends on me having enough time or motivation to implement them all tbh.

- üñºÔ∏è Upload or paste any image (drag & drop, file select, camera on mobile, or paste directly)
- üé® Extracts dominant colors from the uploaded image
- üåà Creates a smooth gradient using the extracted palette
- üîÑ Multiple gradient types (linear, radial, conic)
- üéØ Advanced gradient controls (angle adjustment, radial shapes, positioning)
- üîß Offers multiple gradient strategies, detailed [below](#modes)
- üìÅ Works with uploaded files or pasted images
- üìã Copy gradient as CSS
- ‚öôÔ∏è Download gradient as image
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Smart error handling and file validation

## How It Works

1. You upload or paste an image.
2. Gradie extracts a palette of the most prominent colors.
3. The first color in the palette is considered the dominant color.
4. You choose a Gradie Mode (see [Modes](#modes) for all modes).
5. Customize your gradient with advanced controls like angle, position, and shape options.
6. Gradie generates a smooth gradient using your selection.
7. You export it as CSS or download the image.

## Modes

Gradie supports several modes for generating gradients from your image. Each one starts with the most prominent color (palette[0]) and builds from there.

| Mode Name        | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default**      | Most prominent color + second-most prominent.                                                                          |
| **Surprise Me!** | Most prominent color + a random pick from the rest of the palette.                                                     |
| **Bold Pop**     | Most prominent color + the most visually contrasting color in the palette. Great for high-impact, energetic gradients. |
| **Soft Sweep**   | Most prominent color + the palette color with the most different hue. Creates a warm-to-cool or cool-to-warm effect.   |
| **Full Blend**   | Uses all five palette colors to create a multi-stop gradient.                                                          |
| **Custom**       | You choose any two colors from the extracted palette to create your own combo.                                         |

## Why did I build this?

I saw a nice-looking image, thought the colors in it would look nice as a gradient background, and here we are!
