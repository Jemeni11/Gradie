          Gradie does everything on your device. Image analysis, palette
          generation, gradient rendering, and downloads are all fully local. You
          can literally turn off your Wi-Fi after the page loads and it'll still
          work just fine.

          <p>
            I log a few anonymous events to understand how Gradie's used and
            what to improve. No personal info. Just stuff like:
          </p>
          <ul className="custom-marker-list space-y-1">
            <li>How you added an image (drag, paste, or upload)</li>
            <li>What type/size the image was (not the image itself!)</li>
            <li>Whether it worked or failed to load</li>
            <li>What format you downloaded in (PNG, SVG, etc)</li>
            <li>Whether you enabled enhanced gradient mode</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That's it. I don't know who you are, and I don't want to. You're not
            the droid I'm looking for. <span className="wave-pulse">ðŸ‘‹</span>
